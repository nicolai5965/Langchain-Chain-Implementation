# Langchain-Chain-Implementation
Text Interpretation Code

This repository contains code for text interpretation using OpenAI's models integrated with the LangChain library. The code offers three different approaches to interpret text:


1. Single Chain Processing: Interpret the text using a single chain processing method.

2. Multi-Chain Processing: Analyze text by running it through multiple chains sequentially.

3. Sentiment-Based Multi-Chain Processing: Choose a processing chain based on the sentiment of the text (positive, neutral, or negative) to provide tailored responses.

## Features

1. Credential Retrieval: The code provides a function to retrieve API keys from a Google Sheet, making it secure and efficient to use API keys without hardcoding them.

2. Text Interpreter Classes: 
    TextInterpreter_SingleChain: Interpret text using LangChain's single chain processing.
    TextInterpreter_MultiChain: Sequentially process text through multiple chains.
    SentimentBasedTextInterpreter: Choose a processing chain based on sentiment and provide tailored responses.

3. LangChain Integration: The code seamlessly integrates the LangChain library for structured interpretation and parsing of responses from OpenAI's models.

## Note
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to read from the Google Sheet.
The OpenAI model (gpt-3.5-turbo-0613) is used for all interpretations. Make sure you have access to this model.
