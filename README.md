# Langchain-Chain-Implementation
Text Interpretation Code

This repository contains code for text interpretation using OpenAI's models integrated with the LangChain library. The code offers three different approaches to interpret text:


. Single Chain Processing: Interpret the text using a single chain processing method.

. Multi-Chain Processing: Analyze text by running it through multiple chains sequentially.

. Sentiment-Based Multi-Chain Processing: Choose a processing chain based on the sentiment of the text (positive, neutral, or negative) to provide tailored responses.

## Features

1. Credential Retrieval: The code provides a function to retrieve API keys from a Google Sheet, making it secure and efficient to use API keys without hardcoding them.

2. Text Interpreter Classes: 
  . TextInterpreter_SingleChain: Interpret text using LangChain's single chain processing.
