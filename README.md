Text Interpretation Code

This repository contains code for text interpretation using OpenAI's models integrated with the LangChain library. The code offers three different approaches to interpret text:


. Single Chain Processing: Interpret the text using a single chain processing method.

. Multi-Chain Processing: Analyze text by running it through multiple chains sequentially.

. Sentiment-Based Multi-Chain Processing: Choose a processing chain based on the sentiment of the text (positive, neutral, or negative) to provide tailored responses.
